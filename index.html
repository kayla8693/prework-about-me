      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am not a web developer. I'm taking this bootcamp to change that. I've been a 
        server for the last 4 years, I have 7 siblings (yeah, I know that's a lot), and 
        I can be a bit of a bitch, but only when people deserve it. Good segue into the 
        fact that I'm a Slytherin lol. I used to be really shy, and I still can be 
        sometimes until I get to know people. <strong>I am extremely awkward.</strong> 
        I'm very reliable and loyal, and if I love you I will literally die for you. So 
        yeah that's a little bit about me. You'll get more later if I decide I like you.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Fremont, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Rock climbing, eating, watching Netflix, reading but I haven't done that in a 
        while lol. I also love trying new beers and whiskeys (aka I like to drink, if 
        you can call that a hobby).</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Honestly no idea, still trying to figure that one out haha. I would love to be 
        able to travel and explore while also helping people and making a positive
        impact on the world, or even just a couple people.

      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>McKinney, TX</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a competitve candidate in today's job marktet. I want the freedom 
        to be able to work independently and to travel if I so please. I don't want to 
        be tied down by my lack of skill or usefullness in this new work world we've come 
        to live in. I want a job that will require me to use my brain and solve 
        problems, not just perform tasks that anyone could do. I want to learn a new 
        skill that I can build on for the rest ofmy life. I want to be able to create 
        something from nothing, to be able to have an idea, act on it, and spread it to 
        the world, and hopefully have other people benefit through that idea.
